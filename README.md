## Projects

bincraft is composed by various projects, each for its own goal.

Now we have:

- [sleighcraft](https://github.com/StarCrossPortal/sleighcraft): ghidra-based Rust/Python/NodeJS disassembler/lifter that works as a library
- [bincraft_ghidra](https://github.com/StarCrossPortal/bincraft_ghidra): forked version of ghidra that adds possible default extensions, dark themed UI, etc.
- more under construction!
